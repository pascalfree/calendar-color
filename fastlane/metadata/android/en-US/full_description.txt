A simple app to change the color of a calendar in android 6+. Tested with
calendars provided by baikal.

<b>Kown Issues:</b>

The color is slightly different from what the google calendar app is showing.
The google calendar app seems to tweak the colors a little bit. Colors set in
owncloud are also slightly different in the google calendar app.

The colorchanges back after some time: Many calendar services will overwrite the
color when syncing. Set the color directly in the service (e.g. google,
owncloud) instead.
